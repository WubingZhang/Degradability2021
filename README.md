# Model-based Analysis of Protein Degradability (MAPD) 


## Code for MAPD paper
This repo includes source codes for reproducing analysis in our study.

The source codes for producing each figure are organized in separated Jupyter notebook. All required data and scripts are included in the folder. 

For more detail, please read our paper titled ["Protein intrinsic features predict tractability of targeted protein degradation"]() or visit the shiny app at http://mapd.cistrome.org/.
